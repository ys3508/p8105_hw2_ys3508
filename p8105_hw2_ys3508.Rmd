# Problem 1
## Load/Clean data
```{r}
nyc_mta = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv", 
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  rename(ADA_compliance = ada)%>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))

```

These data are not "tidy" as they now stand; route number and route should both be variables. That is, we would need to change "route" variables from wide to long format in order to have a clean dataset. 
## Answer questions
```{r}
nyc_mta %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct

nyc_mta %>% 
  filter(ADA_compliance == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

There are 465 distinct stations, and 84 of them are ADA compliant.

```{r}
nyc_mta %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

```{r}
nyc_mta %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct

nyc_mta %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A", ADA_compliance == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```
